I'm setting timezone GMT+6 on my Linux machine by copying the zoneinfo file to /etc/localtime, but the date command is showing the time UTCtime-6. What is the reason for this behaviour?

I'm assuming the date command should display UTCtime+6 time. Here are steps I'm following:
date
Wed Jan 22 17:29:01 IST 2014

date -u
Wed Jan 22 11:59:01 UTC 2014

cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/GMT+6 /etc/localtime

date
Wed Jan 22 05:59:21 GMT+6 2014

date -u
Wed Jan 22 11:59:01 UTC 2014
