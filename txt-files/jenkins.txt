assuming that restartapache is an exec task that calls the apache restart command. Eg:

<target name="restartapache" description="Restarts the web server">
    <exec command="/etc/init.d/apache2 restart" />
</target>  
To avoid the sudo command prompting for a password you can update your sudo permissions for whatever user account you are running your build under (this example demonstrates turning off the sudo password prompt for the jenkins user):

sudo visudo
Then add the following lines:

Defaults:jenkins !requiretty,!lecture
jenkins ALL=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/apache2
The above has been edited to improve security according to this answer so that Jenkins is only allowed to restart apache without a password and nothing else.
