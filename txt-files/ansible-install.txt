How to Install Ansible on CentOS 7 via Yum
Category: Technical Support, Tutorials
Ansible is an automation engine, similar to Chef or Puppet, that can be used to ensure deployment and configuration consistency across many servers, and keep servers and applications up-to-date. Though, unlike some other tools, Ansible does not require a client component/agent.

Pre-Flight Check
These instructions are intended specifically for installing Ansible, an automation tool.
I値l be working from a Liquid Web Core Managed CentOS 7 server, and I値l be logged in as non-root user. If you need more information then visit our tutorial on How to Add a User and Grant Root Privileges on CentOS 7.



Step #1: Add the EPEL Repository
Ansible is part of Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL), which is a community repository of non-standard packages for the RHEL distribution. First, we値l install the EPEL repository:

sudo rpm -iUvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm


Step #2: The Installation
As a matter of best practice we値l update our packages:

sudo yum -y update

Then let痴 install Ansible and any required packages:

sudo yum -y install ansible


Step #3: Verify The Installation
Check the version of Ansible that is installed:

ansible --version

Which should yield something similar to:

ansible 1.8.4
configured module search path = None
