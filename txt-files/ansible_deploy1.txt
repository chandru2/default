Install EPEL repo on CentOS 7 / RHEL 7

Method 1 : By directly using yum command
On CentOS 7, we have found without downloading the epel-release RPM package(as we used to do on previous O.S releases), we can install it by using yum command.

yum install epel-release
See below given reference from our system.

[root@localhost ~]# yum install epel-release
