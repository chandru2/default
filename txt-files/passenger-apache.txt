SOLVED.

Apparently, the problem indeed was the misconfigured Rails app. Here's what I found in nginx's error.log:

Exception RuntimeError in Rack application object (Missing `secret_token` and `secret_key_base` for 'production' environment, set these values in `config/secrets.yml`)

Previously Passenger would give more information on why it couldn't start the Rails app. Apparently, the new message replaced that page.

I'm having the same problem. I can add, that I currently have 3 unix users, each having a Rails app in their respective home directory. Only one of the 3 apps (
which was set up as first) is being served properly by Passenger, the other 2 giving "Incomplete response received from application" (both in the browser and with curl), both of them set up with a vanilla, 
freshly generated Rails app.
